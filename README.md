# SkipLSTM-Pytorch
A PyTorch implementation of SkipLSTM for Pytorch 2.3

This implementation is modified from (skiprnn_pytorch)[https://github.com/gitabcworld/skiprnn_pytorch], and corresponds to the paper (Skip RNN: Learning to Skip State Updates in Recurrent Neural Networks)[https://arxiv.org/abs/1708.06834]. 
This works well with Pytorch latest version 2.3.
Limitations: Only single-layer SkipLSTM cell is supported.
